# Java-Beginner
Includes: Calculator, ToDoList, NumberGuessingGame, GradeTracker, SimpleATMSim, AddressBook, TicTacToe


These projects had been developed by me in my 1st year of programming but I chose to upload them on Git late for some reason. Anyways...
This is a small collection of beginner-friendly console programs I built to practice and demonstrate the fundamentals of programming. Each project focuses on key skills — from basic syntax and logic to object-oriented programming (OOP). Here’s a quick overview of what’s covered:

Calculator App
A simple calculator that handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You enter two numbers and pick an operation. I added error handling to avoid crashes from things like dividing by zero or typing letters instead of numbers.

Skills practiced:

Variables

Conditionals

Loops

Basic input/output

To-Do List Manager
A menu-based task manager where you can add, remove, view, and mark tasks as complete. I created a custom Task class for this, making it a good OOP exercise.

Skills practiced:

Collections (ArrayList)

Classes and objects

Loops

Number Guessing Game
The computer picks a random number, and you try to guess it in a limited number of tries. After each guess, you get a hint (too high or too low). You can also choose to play again after each round.

Skills practiced:

Random number generation

Conditionals

Handling user input

Student Grade Tracker
This app lets you enter student names and their grades. It calculates the average and tells whether the student passed or failed. I used arrays and classes to organize everything.

Skills practiced:

Classes and objects

Methods

Arrays

Simple ATM Simulator
A basic ATM app where you can check your balance, deposit, withdraw money, and log in using a PIN. It keeps a record of transactions and includes error handling (e.g., trying to withdraw more than your balance).

Skills practiced:

OOP

Exception handling

Arrays

Text-Based Address Book
A console contact manager where you can add, search, remove, and view contacts (name, phone, email). I used ArrayList or HashMap to store contacts and played around with basic file saving and loading.

Skills practiced:

Collections

Basic file I/O

Tic-Tac-Toe
Classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe in the console with a 3x3 grid. It checks for wins or draws after every move. The board is stored as a 2D array.

Skills practiced:

2D arrays

Conditionals

Loops

How to Run These Projects
Open the project folder.

Compile the main file (usually named Main.java or similar).

Run it using your IDE or terminal.

Just follow the instructions that show up on screen.
